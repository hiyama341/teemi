What is teemi?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**teemi**, named after the Greek goddess of fairness, is a python package designed
to make microbial strain construction reproducible and FAIR (Findable, Accessible, 
Interoperable, and Reusable). With teemi, you can simulate all steps of 
a strain construction cycle, from generating genetic parts to designing 
a combinatorial library and keeping track of samples through a commercial
Benchling API and a low-level CSV file database. 
This tool can be used in literate programming to 
increase efficiency and speed in metabolic engineering tasks. 
To try teemi, visit our `Google Colab notebooks <https://github.com/hiyama341/teemi/tree/main/colab_notebooks>`__.


teemi not only simplifies the strain construction process but also offers the 
flexibility to adapt to different experimental workflows through its open-source
Python platform. This allows for efficient automation of repetitive tasks and
a faster pace in metabolic engineering.

Our demonstration of teemi in a complex machine learning-guided
metabolic engineering task showcases its efficiency 
and speed by debottlenecking a crucial step in the strictosidine pathway. 
This highlights the versatility and usefulness of this tool in various  
biological applications. 

Curious about how you can build strains easier and faster with teemi? 
Head over to our `Google Colab notebooks <https://github.com/hiyama341/teemi/tree/main/colab_notebooks>`__
and give it a try.

Please cite our paper (in preparation - link tba) if you've used teemi in a scientific publication.

Getting started
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To get started with making microbial strains in an HT manner please follow the steps below: 

1. Install teemi. You will find the necessary information below for installation.

2. Check out our `notebooks <https://github.com/hiyama341/teemi/tree/main/colab_notebooks>`__ for inspiration to make HT strain construction with teemi.

3. You can start making your own workflows by importing teemi into either Google colab or Jupyter lab/notebooks.


Colab notebooks
---------------
As a proof of concept we show how teemi and literate programming can be used to streamline bioengineering workflows.
These workflows should serve as a guide or a help to build your own workflows and thereby harnessing the power of literate programming with teemi. 

Specifically, in this study we present how teemi and literate programming to build simulation-guided, iterative,
and evolution-guided laboratory workflows for optimizing strictosidine production in yeast.

Below you can find all the notebooks developed in this work. 
Just click the Google colab badge to start the workflows.
