# teemi strictosidine notebooks

This directory hosts the **Jupyter notebooks** used to generate the results in the Petersen & Levassor et al. _teemi_ paper.  
They exemplify how **literate programming** can enable full Design â†’ Build â†’ Test â†’ Learn (DBTL) workflows in synthetic biology.

## ðŸ›  Usage notes

- Run the notebooks **in sequence** (from early DESIGN to final LEARN) to replicate the analytical flow.
- The notebooks assume specific datasets (genotype, phenotype) and module usage consistent with **teemi**.
- You may link each notebook filename to its corresponding file in your repo (e.g. via GitHub links) for ease of navigation.
- Use this as a **template or scaffold** for your own literate programmingâ€“based bioengineering workflows.
