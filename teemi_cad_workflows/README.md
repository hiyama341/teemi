# 🧬 Teemi CAD Workflows

Welcome to **teemi CAD Workflows** — a growing collection of **cool bioengineering workflows, teemi-style**.

This folder is meant to **inspire** and **demonstrate** what’s possible when you combine  
**computational design**, **biological insight**, and **literate programming**.

Each workflow showcases literate programming philosophy can be applied to real-world bioengineering problems — from DNA assembly planning and part design to data analysis and visualization — in a transparent, reproducible, and narrative-driven way.

## 💡 What’s inside

- Example workflows illustrating the **Design–Build–Test–Learn (DBTL)** cycle
- Demonstrations of **literate programming** in practice (code + explanation + results)
- Reusable templates for your own computational experiments
- Explorations of **automation**, **CAD**, and **computational biology** concepts

## 🌱 How to contribute

If you’ve built a workflow that embodies the **teemi spirit** — clear, creative, and reproducible — feel free to add it here!

Please:

1. Create a jupyter notebook named after your workflow (e.g., `plasmid_assembly_planner.ipynb`).
2. Include a description with the different steps inside explaining what it does.
3. Place all datasets in the shared **`workflow_data/`** folder.
4. Keep dependencies minimal and document them clearly.

## ✨ Inspiration

teemi CAD Workflows is a space for exploring what’s possible when **engineering biology**.  
We believe that sharing workflows in a literate programming, open, and creative format can help make  
**bioengineering more transparent, collaborative, and fun.**
